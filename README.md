# pokeapi_mobile_app
Prepend coding challenge

The app works, there wasnt any specific part of it that requires much description as it's a simple app. 
But it would be much better with a router, to change page for the search (allowing filters maybe) for the list and for the "Pokemon card".

It was the first time for me to ever work with graphQL so it took me a bit of time to understand how to fetch data and write queries but in the end I got it and im really happy about it! I also never really approached ReactNative with Typescript combination, in fact Types and interfaces are not well developed, that would be something I would put much more work in. 
Because of these reasons the App developed in 8 hours and overall needs a lot of clean up (and most probably several components/functions need better naming). 

I was aware of my lacks since the moment I first saw the challenge script but intead of givinig up directly I decided to prove to myself that I can dig into it despite the new technology and the foreign approach, to still deliver a decent product to you who invested time in me as a candidate for your company. 

A feedback on the code would be much apreciated.
